    "    This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with\n",
    "    infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.\n"
